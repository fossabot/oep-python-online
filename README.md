## What

FARE Python Online is a web application to run Python 3.x by means of a web
browser interface.
It presents a menu and two columns, one for inserting the source code and the
other one to see the results. 
If errors occur, a notice is shown and the relative line is underlined in red.

Furthermore, it is possible to read a PDF next to the input/output boxes. 
It is also possible to directly insert some snippets of code in order to be
able to test them straightaway. 

### How to install
1. Download and unpack the latest release
   [here](https://github.com/Free-Polito/fare-python-online/releases)
2. Enter the folder and install the dependencies:  
   `npm install`.   
   This will automagically also create the `bundle.js` file by running `npm run
   build`.
   It also runs the `postinstall.sh` BASH script which clones the
   [exercises](https://github.com/Open-Education-Polito/oep-esercizi-python)
   repository allowing to have the complete experience. 
3. Open the HTML file `dist/index.html` in a browser.  
4. Enjoy!

### Hacking
Since this project has different purposes, it has been developed using JS
without a specific framework (i.e., nodejs). This means that it may be a bit
tricky to handle configuration. 
In this case, custom configuration parameters are passed by means of the
`webpack.config.js` file which is structured as follow:

```javascript
// Defining variables to pass to app.js
plugins: [
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  "fare" : false,
  "book": false,
  "saveit" : false,
  "exercises" : false,
  "turtle" : false,
  "robot" : true,
  // Insert the server API endpoint
  "postUrl" : JSON.stringify("<a_api_endpoint_url>")
}),
]
```
so, each of those JSON elements is treated as a variable in the `app.js` file.
This raises some problems (for example with the linter which has to be
suppressed) but provides a sort of flexible way to handle configuration
parameters for building. 

For reference:
* fare : if this project has to be included in the FARE Drupal module.
* book: enable or not the possibility to toggle the PDF reader.
* saveit: enable or not the possibility to save.
* exercises: enable or not the possibility to load into the `input box` the
  exercises read from the dedicated repo.
* turtle: enable or not the turtle canvas output.
* robot: enable or not the remote laboratory functionalities (todo). 
* postUrl: an api endpoint url.
